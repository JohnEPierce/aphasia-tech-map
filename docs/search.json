Functions include adding users (PWA),\nadding assets (pictures, audio files for verbal cues) and linking\nassets, selecting and allocating pictures to stimulus sets, adjusting\nthe amount of time the PWA has to respond to cues throughout treatment.\nThe experimental set up also allows for probe sessions and capturing\npre- and post-session subjective ratings of fatigue, motivation and task\ndifficulty. The web-app can produce reports about sessions (timing data,\nsubjective ratings response data, items probed/treated, etc) in excel\nformat.\nFuture plans include expanding web-app (items, users), allowing\nindependent practice (free-use), adding speech recognition to support\nindependent practice.\n\n\n\n\nMeasuring, Monitoring, and Motivating Adherence to Self-Managed Aphasia\nTreatment.\n\nPrinciple Investigator(s):\n\nCIA Dr Sarah Jane Wallace The University of Queensland CIB Prof David A\nCopland The University of Queensland CIC Prof Janet Wiles The University\nof Queensland CID Assoc Prof Anthony J Angwin The University of\nQueensland CIE Assoc Prof Victoria Jane Palmer University of Melbourne\nCIF Dr Peter Harold Worthy The University of Queensland CIG Dr Anne Jane\nHill The University of Queensland CIH Dr Barbra H.

The core of the program is a\ncomputer-based naming therapy, that will be combined with a training of\ncommunication strategies relevant for everyday life. A trained speech\ntherapist will provide treatment via the internet. We will also work\nwith the manufacturer of the brain stimulation device, to make it easy\nand comfortable for patients or their carers to administer the\nstimulation. The project has two main goals: (1) first, we will\nrepeatedly consult with patients, their carers and patient advocacy\ngroups to identify specific needs and potential barriers with regard to\nhow assessments and therapy will be conducted. This information will be\nused to optimize the existing treatment program for home-based use and\npatients with primary progressive aphasia. (2) Subsequently, we will\nimplement and test the procedures and technology in a small group of\npatients in their homes to find out how well their needs and wishes have\nbeen considered and make further adjustments, if necessary. With this\niterative process, we aim to enhance adherence to this novel treatment\nprogram, its effectiveness and ultimately patient benefit.\n\n\n\n\nSwaracharya\n\nPrinciple Investigator(s):\n\nNisheeth Joshi, Pragya Kartyayan, Chitvan Mishra, Shefali Gupta\n\nEmail:\n\nnisheeth.joshi@rediffmail.com\n\nCountry:\n\nBanasthali, India\n\nFunding Source:\n\n\n\nPhase of Research:\n\nPhase II - Feasibility, acceptability, preliminary efficacy\n\nPlan to Commercalise:\n\nYes\n\nCategory:\n\nSpecific app (mobile or computer software; including software designed\nfor telehealth delivery), Augmentative and Alternive Communication,\ncommunication accessibility (e.g. text to speech feature), Artificial\nIntelligence/Machine learning\n\nBrief Description:\n\nThe project helps in rehab of Aphasia patients who have difficulty in\nspeaking.

TherapyBox has developed an\nautomated system for recording, transcribing, and analysing typical and\natypical speech in children with language disorder [see https://www.languageexplorer.app/], which has easy\ntransferable application to atypical speech in adults with aphasia. This\napplication is referred to as MARS and would incorporate the specific\nLUNA discourse analyses as well as explore stakeholders’ additional\nideas. The LUNA-TherapyBox collaboration brings together expertise in\nmachine learning, general and specialist UX with this clinical\npopulation, theoretical and applied clinical linguistics, and current\nknowledge of national therapist practice and behaviour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
