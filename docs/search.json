Feasibility outcomes of this trial explored\nrecruitment and retention, willingness to be randomised, compliance with\nand acceptability of the treatment and of the outcome measures. A range\nof outcome measures were used that explored word finding in picture\nnaming and discourse, functional communication, language, mood and\nquality of life.\n\n\n\n\n\nKeyPhone\n\n\nPrinciple Investigator(s): Victoria Fleming, Wendy Best, Wei Ping Sze,\nand team\n\n\nCountry: London, UK and Singapore\n\n\nFunding Source:\n\n\nPhase of Research: Phase II - Feasibility, acceptability, preliminary\nefficacy\n\n\nPlan to Commercalise: Yes\n\n\nCategory: Specific app (mobile or computer software; including software\ndesigned for telehealth delivery)\n\nBrief Description:\n\nUse of orthographic cues in intervention with people with anomia.\n\nAdditional Comments:\n\nProof of concept was established in the 1980s by Carolyn Bruce, David\nHoward and team.

The core of the program is a\ncomputer-based naming therapy, that will be combined with a training of\ncommunication strategies relevant for everyday life. A trained speech\ntherapist will provide treatment via the internet. We will also work\nwith the manufacturer of the brain stimulation device, to make it easy\nand comfortable for patients or their carers to administer the\nstimulation. The project has two main goals: (1) first, we will\nrepeatedly consult with patients, their carers and patient advocacy\ngroups to identify specific needs and potential barriers with regard to\nhow assessments and therapy will be conducted. This information will be\nused to optimize the existing treatment program for home-based use and\npatients with primary progressive aphasia. (2) Subsequently, we will\nimplement and test the procedures and technology in a small group of\npatients in their homes to find out how well their needs and wishes have\nbeen considered and make further adjustments, if necessary. With this\niterative process, we aim to enhance adherence to this novel treatment\nprogram, its effectiveness and ultimately patient benefit.\n\n\n\n\nModulating stimulus intensity to improve clinical outcomes in aphasia\ntreatment (MIDAS)\n\n\nPrinciple Investigator(s): Leora Cherney and Sarel van Vuuren (MPI)\n\n\nCountry: Chicago, United States\n\n\nFunding Source: NIH - R01 (5 years)\n\n\nPhase of Research: Phase III - Efficacy\n\n\nPlan to Commercalise: Yes\n\n\nCategory: Specific app (mobile or computer software; including software\ndesigned for telehealth delivery)\n\nBrief Description:\n\nAn RCT to investigate stimulus repetition and stimulus distribution as\nfactors that modulate dose and intensity of treatment.\n\nAdditional Comments:\n\nThe goal is not to assess the technology - but we are using the\ntechnology to facilitate the study.
